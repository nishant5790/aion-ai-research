  `[n] Title - URL`
- For "comparative" queries, add a comparison summary table where useful.
- For "deep_research", include a `## Limitations / Open Questions` section
  containing only SUBSTANTIVE open research questions about the topic itself

  failures, missing API responses, or research-process limitations here.
- Do NOT use self-referential language ("I researched...", "we gathered...").
- HARD RULE — NEVER mention any of the following in the report:
  * tool names (e.g. fetch_trends, think_tool) or that a tool was called
  * tool errors, timeouts, empty responses, or rate limits
  * sub-agent names or that a sub-agent succeeded/failed

You receive a validated text-only Markdown report and the original aggregated

2. **enhanced_report** — the same report enhanced with placement markers where
   each chart should be inserted: ``{{{{CHART:<index>}}}}`` (0-indexed).

**ALWAYS USE** (when data is present):
- Numerical comparisons (performance, metrics, rankings) → bar chart or horizontal_bar
- Time series or trends → line or area chart
- Distribution or market share → pie chart
- Feature/capability comparison → matrix or comparison_table
- Process workflows or systems → flowchart or architecture
- Mathematical relationships or formulas → formula (with LaTeX)
- Correlation or intensity patterns → heatmap
- Key metrics highlights → stat_card

**NEVER GENERATE** (exclude these):
- Charts about metadata (number of sources, count of references, etc.)
- Charts about methodology (how many tools were used, etc.)
- Redundant charts (don't repeat the same data twice)

GUIDELINES:
- Generate 3–8 visualizations. Prioritize variety: mix chart types (bar, line, flowchart, formula).
- Use REAL data from the report and aggregated research. Never invent numbers.
- For process/workflow topics → include flowchart or architecture diagram.
- For technical/mathematical content → include formula if applicable.
- For system comparisons → use matrix or architecture diagram.
- Place each chart immediately AFTER the paragraph/section it illustrates.
- Keep report text intact; only add {{{{CHART:<index>}}}} markers.
- Ensure enhanced_report is valid Markdown.

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Do NOT create charts for metadata (e.g., "We found 15 sources" → NO chart).
2. Do NOT create redundant visualizations of the same data.
3. Prioritize substance: visualize the key findings, not the process.
4. Each chart must add unique insight to the report.
5. Use descriptive captions that explain the insight.
